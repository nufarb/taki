# Taki

I made this project as part of a Python course I took at Pirple.com. 
The purpose of this project was to turn a card game into a Python program.
The card game I chose called "Taki".

This is one of my favorite games, both as a child and today. You can see the game 
concept and the rules here -->   https://www.takigame.com/taki-game-rules
